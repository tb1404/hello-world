Hello World, 
  My name is Torrie and I am currently a cartography student at HSU in Northern California. I found an interest in cartography after taking the first 2 courses for the ESRI GIS Certification program. I found GIS did not allow for much wiggle room outside of analysis and data collection, whereas Cartography permits a more playful side of mapping and allows me to get in touch with my creative side. 
  I look forward to seeing what skill I develop in this course. The first being the use of Github!
